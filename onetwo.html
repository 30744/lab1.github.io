 <h2>My student lifeâ€¦</h2>
 <p>
Two years ago I entered a new stage of life and I am glad 
that I met good people at my university. Even if our group 
is not the most friendly, but I found my people. We are 
very different, but this is what helps us to be in harmony.  
Each of them has its own zest and peculiarity.  We love 
spontaneous decisions, reckless actions, singing, and we 
love the mountains, because it was in the mountains that 
we left pieces of our friendship together.
